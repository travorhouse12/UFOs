# Overview of Project
The goal of the project was to assist a journalist named Dana in creating an HTML page that displayed an article about UFO sightings as well as a dynamic table that contains all UFO sighting information and reacts based on the search criteria entered by the user. In a JavaScript array, data about UFO sightings was saved for this project. This table of UFO sightings was rendered as a fully dynamic table in an HTML page. Allowing the user to filter the table's data using search criteria, including:
• Date
• City
• State
• Country
• Shape

The table responds to user input based on the filtered criteria and also displays Dana's article, making it an excellent visualization for anyone interested in UFO sightings.

## Results
To the left of the table lies search criteria that enables Dana and others to easily sift and find specific data according to date, city, state, country, and shape. This will make the search process easy and create more time for the most important stuff.

All the user has to do is insert what information they want to see and click enter on their keyboard. the webpage will then display the information that they requested. 

If you type in, for example, "grants pass", results will populate. If you type in "grants pass", then "ca",no results will populate. 

## Summary
Users can only look at a specific item at a time. You can't compare two cities or states. As this page undergoes further iterations, I would reccomend the ability to compare any of the various criteria. Furthermore, I would suggest the ability to easily create graphs that allow for easy visualization. This way, the end-user can identify trends.
